        "synopsis": "Whenever Naruto Uzumaki proclaims that he will someday become the Hokage\u2014a title bestowed upon the best ninja in the Village Hidden in the Leaves\u2014no one takes him seriously. Since birth, Naruto has been shunned and ridiculed by his fellow villagers. But their contempt isn't because Naruto is loud-mouthed, mischievous, or because of his ineptitude in the ninja arts, but because there is a demon inside him. Prior to Naruto's birth, the powerful and deadly Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village. In order to stop the rampage, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the body of the newborn Naruto. And so when he is assigned to Team 7\u2014along with his new teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the mentorship of veteran ninja Kakashi Hatake\u2014Naruto is forced to work together with other people for the first time in his life. Through undergoing vigorous training and taking on challenging missions, Naruto must learn what it means to work in a team and carve his own route toward becoming a full-fledged ninja recognized by his village. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Minato Namikaze and his wife Kushina Uzumaki\u2014who was the jinchuuriki at the time of the attack\u2014sealed away the demon inside their new born son: Naruto Uzumaki. However, this act of saving the village cost them their lives and they left the future of the ninja world to Naruto. With the demon fox sealed away, things continued as normal. However, the peace of the village would not last long, for Pain, Konan, Itachi Uchiha, Kisame Hoshigaki, Sasori, Deidara, Hidan and Kakuzu\u2014members of a dreaded shinobi group called the Akatsuki\u2014attacked Konohagakure.

The mystery remains, but the shinobi are praised by heir families for completing such a dangerous mission. However, one of them who has never known the faces of his parents, Naruto, cannot help but feel lonely. At that exact time, suddenly, the masked man makes his appearance in Konoha.

        "synopsis": "Naruto Uzumaki has finally achieved his dream of becoming Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village that he spent his teenage years fighting to protect. Naruto and his peers now live in a world of peace, working hard to uphold an international truce built on good will and diplomacy. However, this stasis comes at a personal cost for the aging hero. Naruto and the shinobi he grew up alongside find that working to upkeep the neutral world takes them away from their families, and even the legendary warriors of Naruto's generation must contend with being mediocre parents to their bitter children, including his own son Boruto. Boruto Uzumaki faces a world completely unlike that of his father, finding unique trouble in the distance between the two. Contending with a society that heaps an unbearable load of pressure on his shoulders over his status as the Hokage's son, Boruto carves his own path through the world, fighting to make a name for himself as evil forces threaten to shatter the peace his father helped create.

To prevent the world from being destroyed, the demon has to be sealed and the only one who can do it is the shrine maiden Shion from the country of demons, who has two powers; one is sealing demons and the other is predicting the deaths of humans. This time Naruto's mission is to guard Shion, but she predicts Naruto's death. The only way to escape it, is to get away from Shion, which would leave her unguarded, then the demon, whose only goal is to kill Shion will do so, thus meaning the end of the world. Naruto decides to challenge this \"prediction of death,\" but fails to prove Shion's prediction wrong and supposedly dies in vain. (Source: Wikipedia)",
